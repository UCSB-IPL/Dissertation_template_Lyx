\begin_layout Abstract
Millimeter waves (mmW) ranging in frequency from 30 to 
\begin_inset Formula $300\ GHz$
\end_inset

 provide a tremendous amount of spectrum to meet the rapid growth of wireless
 data traffic demand.
 The W-band (75 - 100
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $GHz$
\end_inset

) mmW frequencies are particularly attractive as they can support links
 faster than 
\begin_inset Formula $100\ Gbps$
\end_inset

.
 Microwave photonics (MWP) is promising for mmW signal generation due to
 the frequency-independent low optical loss.
 For mmW phased array antennas (PAAs), wide bandwidth and low loss optical
 true time delays (TTDs) mitigate the beam squint issue and reduce power
 consumption in comparison to RF phase shifters that require driver amplifiers.
 In combination with integrated photonics where large scale and compact
 TTDs can be realized, integrated MWP is particularly suitable for mmW PAA
 beamforming ultra-high-speed communications.

\begin_layout Abstract
Among the various tunable integrated TTD implementations, switched delay
 lines (SDLs) and optical ring resonators (ORRs) are particularly promising
 for large scale optical beamforming networks (OBFNs) for PAAs.
 In this thesis, both SDL and ORR based TTD devices have been investigated,
 with emphasis on the reduction of ripple in the delay spectrum.
 A ripple-free SDL architecture was developed based on Mach-Zehnder interferomet
er (MZI) optical switches, and a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times4$
\end_inset

 OBFN using 5-stage SDLs was realized for linear PAAs.
 Ultra-low loss silicon nitride was used as an integrated photonics technology
 platform.
 Six delay configurations with 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1.5$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $4.5$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $7.5\ ps$
\end_inset

 path delay incremental steps were demonstrated for the SDL-OBFN.
 The ORR based delay lines were optimized to minimize the ripple in the
 delay response by applying a genetic algorithm, which revealed a tradeoff
 between the ripple level, delay value, bandwidth and total number of rings
 used.
 A 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times4$
\end_inset

 3-ORR (three rings in each path) based OBFN was optimized.
 An ORR-OBFN architecture where one ORR is shared by two adjacent paths
 was determined to reasonably balance the ripple level and system complexity.
 Two 3-ORR based 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times4$
\end_inset

 OBFNs with the architecture of sharing one and two ORRs were realized on
 the silicon nitride platform as well.
 With optimized tuning, a single 3-ORR delay line generated continuous tuning
 ranges of 
\begin_inset Formula $209\ ps$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $172\ ps$
\end_inset

 for bandwidths of 
\begin_inset Formula $6.3\ GHz$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $8.6\ GHz$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 Delay responses with delay increment of 
\begin_inset Formula $4.6\ ps$
\end_inset

 for linear PAAs were generated by the two ORR-OBFNs, both of which demonstrated
 that the OBFN with one ORR shared exhibits much more flattened delay spectrum
 as expected.
 Based on the results, both the SDL-OBFN and ORR-OBFN are considered extremely
 promising for directional beamforming with PAAs.

\begin_layout Abstract
Integrated OBFN chips were packaged and used in experiments for mmW signal
 generation and beamsteering.
 The ORR-OBFN was utilized for a 
\begin_inset Formula $41\ GHz$
\end_inset

 mmW signal generation experiment.
 The SDL-OBFN was utilized for a W-band signal beamsteering experiment.
 Six beam angles from -51° to 31°, with at least 
\begin_inset Formula $15\ GHz$
\end_inset

 TTD bandwidth from 
\begin_inset Formula $85$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $100\ GHz$
\end_inset

, and an SNR of 
\begin_inset Formula $35\ dB$
\end_inset

 were demonstrated.
 Also, a 
\begin_inset Formula $94\ GHz$
\end_inset

 W-band signal with 
\begin_inset Formula $3\ Gbps$
\end_inset

 amplitude shift keying (ASK) data was generated and the spectrum was measured.
 To the author's best knowledge, this is the first report of W-band beamsteering
 and data transmission using an integrated OBFN.

\begin_layout Abstract
To further improve the scalability and reduce the power consumption and
 complexity of the current PAA system, the ongoing work on OBFN-photodiode-anten
na integration has been considered.
 Also, a novel recirculating delay loop (RDL) based OBFN architecture was
 proposed.
 This re-uses a single TTD element for the signal delays in all channels.
 Some of the required components for this RDL-OBFN have been realized.
