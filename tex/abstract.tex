MicrowavePhotonics (MWP) is a frequency agile technology for microwave signal
generations over all RF bands. Particularly, in W band, MWP is more promising for mmW generation at such high frequency than traditional RF circuits due to the low loss of optical fiber. In combination with true time delays (TTDs), which mitigate the beam squint issue incurred by using phase shifters, MWP is particularly suitable for beam forming for mmW phased array antennas (PAA) with ultra-high speed communications.


The rapid growth of the mobile data traffic brought about increasing demand for bandwidth. Millimeter Waves ranging from 30 to 300\ GHz provide a tremendous amount of spectrum to meet this demand. For example, the mmW frequencies of 28\ GHz and 38\ GHz are widely used for the 5G celluar network which could provide up to 10\ Gbps celluar links. As for extremely high bit rate links such as 100\ Gbps, given the atmospheric attenuation, available spectrum and antenna aperture limitation, the W-band (75 - 100?GHz) mmW signal has the lowest link budget, especially for long haul communication. Generally, the atmospheric attenuation increases with signal frequency. Therefore, directional beamforming is required for mmWs to increase the antenna gain and compensate this signal attenuation.
